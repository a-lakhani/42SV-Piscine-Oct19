Assignments, projects, and documents from my time in the October 2019 Piscine at 42 School. 

This was an intensive 28-day, 7-day/week coding bootcamp. It was project-based and driven by an ethos of self- and peer-to-peer learning. There were no teachers besides Google, man pages, and each other. :)

I practiced: writing programs in C almost exclusively using self-written libraries; shell scripts; git; and got an introduction basic data structures such as linked lists and trees. ALL code is my own original work.

Learn more about the school at 42.us.org. It aims to provide a comprehensive software engineering curriculum, is completely free, and offers housing to students that meet certain progress requirements. It is a great fit for those that prefer to learn by doing and define their own pace.
